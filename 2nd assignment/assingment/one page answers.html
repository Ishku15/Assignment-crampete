        <p>The Realme 7 Pro isn't even announced yet but the speculated specifications say that the device would be having a fingerprint sensor.

            The chances are that the sensor would be present at the side, on the power button on the device.</p>

    <p>This is a feature which is there in all the iPhones. Yes, it looks cool when the LED light blinks whenever there is a notification. Let us see how android users can use the same on their phones.

        There is an app by the name of "Flash Notifications". You can find this app here.
        Process is simple, download the app and select which all applications you wish to connect to Flash Notifications.
        You can configure settings like the length of flash, the number of times you want the flash.
        Once done, you are good to go. You can simply test it by calling on your number from another device.
        </p>

    <p>Motorola hasn't made any statement of this device having any higher screen refresh rate.

        So, it can be said that the  Motorola One Fusion Plus comes with the usual 60Hz screen refresh rate.</p>
